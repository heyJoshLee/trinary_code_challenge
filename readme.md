Write a program that will convert a trinary number, represented as a string (e.g. '102012'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (without using an existing method or library that can work with numeral systems).

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid trinary as the value 0.

Trinary numbers contain three symbols: 0, 1, and 2.

The last place in a trinary number is the 1's place. The second to last is the 3's place, the third to last is the 9's place, etc.
